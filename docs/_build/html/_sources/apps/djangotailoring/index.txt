The main application of ``djangotailoring`` contains the basic feature set
required to build a tailored web application. This includes ``tailoring2``
Subject storage and composition, template tags to insert tailored content
into Django templates, as well as generic views to encapsulate basic request
handling. In addition, there are a few Django management commands and
utilities that help in building parts of the ``djangotailoring`` project
infrastructure.
